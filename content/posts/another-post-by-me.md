not much to blog about but i have been working on [aniyomi](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi) again for hours on end without making any progress...  
been listening to "flamewall" by camellia on repeat cause it got qualified on osu! today lol  
i hope you are having a fine swell day, and if not, i hope your next day will be even finer and sweller!
