i'm writing this at 5:44 am, i've been awake this whole time coding stuff for [this website](https://new.osm.jmir.xyz) but now i just felt like writing this blog post.  
there's no point cause no one knows about this or reads this, but whatever.  
i listened to reol, imperial circus dead decadence, c√∂ shu nie and some other stuff spotify autoplayed, was fun.  
tomorrow is friday though so i still have to sleep now.  
bye.
