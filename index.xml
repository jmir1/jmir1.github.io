it has been an awesome learning experience, even though a lot of the work required was just copying classes and changing some strings in them
(to replicate tachiyomi&amp;rsquo;s functionality for a different kind of medium), which was extremely tedious and annoying.&lt;br>
i learned a lot about kotlin and android and all in all it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite fun! (i even get to watch anime on my phone, for testing purposes of course)&lt;br>
i gave my fork the name &amp;ldquo;Tachiyomi-MI&amp;rdquo; (tachi yomi = standing reading; mi = watching). yeah it&amp;rsquo;s not really a good name but it kinda(?) makes sense? idk&lt;br>
another thing: i was very thankful that one other person i know on discord helped out a lot with providing input and pointing out bugs etc.&lt;br>
it really made the process more enjoyable, knowing that another person is interested and benefits from the work i put into this.&lt;br>

so i started by copying and rewriting a buch of classes for the new anime functionality (this is also my first time using kotlin so that&amp;rsquo;s cool)
after many many hours i finally got it to compile and not crash instantly when opening the app!</description><content>&lt;p>so a few days ago i had the brilliant idea of making a fork of &lt;a href="https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi">tachiyomi&lt;/a> (a superb app for reading manga and comics etc.)

so i started by copying and rewriting a buch of classes for the new anime functionality (this is also my first time using kotlin so that&amp;rsquo;s cool)&lt;br>
after many many hours i finally got it to compile and not crash instantly when opening the app! wow! sadly, pretty much nothing is implemented yet,
i only added a new tab at the bottom that doesn&amp;rsquo;t do anything yet.&lt;br>
the best thing about tachiyomi are the source extensions though. you can download extensions for the app that are basically webscrapers of manga websites.
those let you download and read what you want, from literally hundreds of websites to choose from!&lt;br>
so the next step was (i think) to make a new extension for an anime site (i am using my own (&lt;a href="https://2dgirls.tech">2dgirls.tech&lt;/a>) because it just works and is the simplest website ever.&lt;br>
i had to rewrite some stuff in the github action scripts (and i learned how to sign an apk!) and now i have my own repo of tachiyomi extensions!&lt;br>
sadly, the app has a lot of bugs and my extension isn&amp;rsquo;t displayed in the extension download section ;(&lt;br>
so that&amp;rsquo;s basically where i&amp;rsquo;m at right now. what&amp;rsquo;s left is to fix the current bugs and implement a video player, then rewrite the tracking functions (anilist etc.)&lt;br>
this leaves me thinking if i&amp;rsquo;m in a bit over my head&amp;hellip;&lt;br>
nevertheless, if i finish this or not, it will have been a good learning experience, as i&amp;rsquo;ve never developed an android app before!&lt;br>
that&amp;rsquo;s all, good night!&lt;br>
